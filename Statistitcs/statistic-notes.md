**Mean**: The average of all the integers in a set of values. Here is the basic formula for calculating the mean of a set of values. 

**Median**: The midpoint value of a data set for which an equal number of samples are less than and greater than the value. For an odd sample size, this is the middle element of the sorted sample; for an even sample size, this is the average of the 2 middle elements of the sorted sample.
